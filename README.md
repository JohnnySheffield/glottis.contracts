# Glottis Protocol

A fair and transparent protocol for creating tokens with customizable price curves. Launch your token with confidence using mathematically elegant price discovery.

## What is Glottis?

Glottis Protocol combines the best of bonding curves with automated market making to create a fair token launch experience. It uses beautiful B√©zier curves to control token pricing and ensures everyone gets an equal chance to participate.

## Key Features

### üé® Design Your Token Launch
- Create tokens easily with your own price curve
- Choose how aggressive or gradual you want the price to increase
- No special privileges - everyone plays by the same rules

### üìà Smart Price Discovery
- Price follows a smooth curve divided into 100 equal steps
- Each step has a fixed amount of tokens at a predictable price
- No sudden jumps or unfair advantages

### üîÑ Automatic Trading
1. Initial Mint: Mint/Burn tokens as they follow your designed price curve
2. Liquidity Creation: Automatically creates a Uniswap trading pool
3. Open Trading: Free trading begins on Uniswap

### üõ°Ô∏è Fair Launch Guarantees
- Equal access for all participants
- Transparent pricing from start to finish
- No backdoors or special allocations
- Small fees to align incentives

## Additional Info

### Trading Lifecycle
1. Initial Mint/Burn Phase
   - Price follows the defined B√©zier curve
   - Tokens are minted progressively through 100 steps
   - Each step has a fixed amount of tokens at a fixed price
   - Small burn fee (0.35%) to discourage immediate dumping
   
2. Liquidity Creation
   - After initial sale completes, equal amount of tokens are minted for liquidity
   - Collected ETH is used to create a Uniswap V2 liquidity pool
   - Fair fee distribution between protocol, creator, and caller

3. Open Trading
   - Trading becomes unlocked after liquidity pool creation
   - Tokens can be freely traded on Uniswap


### Fee Structure
- Uniswap Pool Creation:
  - Protocol Fee: 0.20%
  - Creator Fee: 0.10%
  - Caller Fee: 0.05%
- Trading:
  - Burn Fee: 0.35%
  - Mint fee: 0.00%

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contracts
- **Glottis20Mint**: the Mint contract handling token creation and sales
  - Manages token deployment
  - Handles bonding curve calculations
  - Controls minting and burning
  - Manages liquidity pool creation

- **Glottis20**: ERC20 implementation with additional features
  - Controlled minting through the Mint
  - Trading lock mechanism
  - Immutable supply and decimals

### Price Calculation
The protocol uses efficient mathematical implementations for B√©zier curve calculations:
```solidity
// Cubic B√©zier curve formula:
// P = (1-t)¬≥P‚ÇÄ + 3(1-t)¬≤tP‚ÇÅ + 3(1-t)t¬≤P‚ÇÇ + t¬≥P‚ÇÉ
```
